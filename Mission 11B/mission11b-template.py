# With these operations, compound generic operations can be defined, such as
# def square(x):
#   return mul(x, x)

# (a) What are the types of the input and output of the generic square operation?
# Answer:

# (b) Why would we prefer to define square in the above way, rather than:
# def square(x):
#    return apply_generic("square", x)

# Task 2 #
##########
# In the ordinary number package, a generic number operator is indexed by the
# name of the operator and a tuple of strings. For example, the add operator is
# indexed by ’add_ord’ and (’ordinary’, ’ordinary’); negation is indexed by
# ’negate_ord’ and (’ordinary’, ).
# In contrast, the constructor that creates an ordinary number is indexed by
# ’make_ord’ and just a string ’ordinary’. Explain why we have such a difference.

# Hint: Consider the differences in the process of the creation of a Generic-Num,
# such as create_ordinary, and the operations we can apply on Generic-Num, such
# as add. How is make_ord invoked, and how is add_ord invoked?

# Task 3 #

# There’s a right way and a wrong way to create a generic complex number. Here are two tries at
# producing 9+10i. Which is the right way?

# first_try = create_complex(9, 10)
# second_try = create_complex(create_ordinary(9), create_ordinary(10))

# What happens when you use the wrong way to produce 9+10i and 3+10i and then try to add
# them? Why does this happen?

# Right way:
# What happens:
# Why it happens:

# Task 4 #

# Produce expressions that define c2_plus_7i to be the generic complex number whose real part is 2
# and whose imaginary part is 7, and c3_plus_1i to be the generic complex number whose real part
# is 3 and whose imaginary part is 1. Assume that the expression
# >>> csq = square(sub(c2_plus_7i, c3_plus_1i))
# is evaluated. Draw a box and pointer diagram that represents csq.

# As an example, the following is a box and pointer diagram that represents x, a Generic-
# Ord number:
# x = create_ordinary(5)
#
#         +---+---+---+---+
# x  -->  |       |       |
#         +---+---+---+---+
#             |       |
#             v       v
#         "ordinary"  5

# FILL IN YOUR ANSWERS HERE:
# c2_plus_7i =
# c3_plus_1i =

# csq = square(sub(c2_plus_7i, c3_plus_1i))
